# Let’s design a database which will store the relevant information needed to operate a cinema.
# What kind of information do we need to store?
# What are the different concepts a cinema needs to interact with?
# How is that information connected?
# What are the relationships between the different datasets?
# What business needs and what kind of processes does the database have to satisfy?
# Think about the process you go through when you go to a cinema or book a ticket online:
#   ●you need to see a list of movies and the times they run,
#   ●you need to see if there are any available seats,
#   ●you need to be able to make a reservation for one or more seats,
#   ●you need to be able to buy a ticket.

# How would you model all this?

# 1.List all movies.
# 2.List all movies running on 2020-01-01.
# 3.List all movies that are not yet scheduled to run in the cinema.
# 4.List all movies reserved by John Johnson.
# 5.List all the seat rows and numbers reserved by John Johnson.
# 6.List all tickets sold for Joker.
# 7.List the number of adult and children tickets sold for Joker.
# 8.List the average number of tickets sold for each movie.
# 9.List the highest number of tickets sold for a movie.
# 10.List the unreserved seats for Joker.
